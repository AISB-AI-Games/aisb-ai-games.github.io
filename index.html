        <p>In the past decade, the AISB AI & Games symposium has acted as a meeting place for researchers and practitioners from academia and industry who are involved with the design, development and evaluation of AI in the context of games. The new version of the symposium aims to strengthen the undergraduate and postgraduate research contributions for the symposium as well.</p>
        <p>The Symposium focuses on the application of artificial intelligence techniques, frameworks and theories to any aspect of play and games.  In a gaming context AI has a variety of use cases, from algorithmic generation to making a game more engaging, personalised, and/or interactive.</p>
        <p>Authors could be specialised in: AI, machine learning, planning, narrative, education and training, media, multimedia, virtual reality and virtual experiences, game design and development, game interaction design, characters design, interaction design an evaluation for children and/or adults, and any other relevant area.</p>
        <p>The Symposium is usually run over one day with a keynote to motivate and challenge the attendees. During the session, the authors present their paper or demo. A separate poster and demo session will be run to further engage with specific topics.</p>

      <div class="col col-r">
        <p>Submissions can discuss and present published work as long as the work has not been published in the same form. However, the submission should be tailored towards the AISB community. The main aim for the symposium is to give attendees an opportunity to discuss current work and work in progress from an academic as well as professional perspective.</p>
        <p>We invite submissions of the following kinds:</p>
        <ul class="list-marker-check">
          <li>Extended Abstracts (2–4 pages)</li>
          <li>Short papers (4–6 pages)</li>
          <li>Posters (one slide, and one page for the proceedings)</li>
          <li>Demonstrations (2 pages description of what is going to be demonstrated)</li>
          <li>Tutorials (max 2 pages description of planned tutorial content)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Selected high-quality submissions extended and re-reviewed will be included in a journal special issue (TBC).</p>
